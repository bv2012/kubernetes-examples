8.4: Application TRoublshooting- Domain Review

1. Find and use the troubleshoot-review1.yaml file to create a deployment. The create command will fail. Edit the file to fix issues such that a single pod runs for at least a minute without issue. There are several things to fix.
```
student@cp:˜$ kubectl create -f troubleshoot-review1.yaml
1 <Fix any errors found here>

```

When fixed it should look like this:

```
student@cp:˜$ kubectl get deploy igottrouble
NAME READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE
igottrouble 1/1 1 1 5m13s

```
2. Remove any resources created during this review.
