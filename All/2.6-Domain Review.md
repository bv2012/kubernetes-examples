• A new pod with the nginx image. Showing all containers running and a Ready status.
• A new service exposing the pod as a nodePort, which presents a working webserver configured in the previous
step.
• Update the pod to run the nginx:1.11-alpine image and re-verify you can view the webserver via a nodePort.

Find and use the architecture-review1.yaml file included in the course tarball. Your path, such as course number,
may be different than the one in the example below. Use the find output. Determine if the pod is running. Fix any errors
you may encounter. The use of kubectl describe may be helpful.
student@cp:˜$ find $HOME -name architecture-review1.yaml
1 <some_long_path>/architecture-review1.yaml
student@cp:˜$ cp <copy-paste-from-above> .
student@cp:˜$ kubectl create -f architecture-review1.yaml
12. Remove any pods or services you may have created as part of the review before moving on to the next section. For
example:
student@cp:˜$ kubectl delete -f architecture-review1.yaml
