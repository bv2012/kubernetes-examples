3.4: Domain Review

** Understand Muti-Container Pod Design patterns (e.g. ambassodor, adapter, siebar)

** Understand LivenessProbes, ReadinessProbes

** Understand container logging.


1. Using the three URL locations allowed by the exam, find and bookmark working YAML examples for LivenessProbes, ReadinessProbes, and multi-container pods.

2. Deploy a new nginx webserver. Add a LivenessProbe and a ReadinessProbe on port 80. Test that both probes and the webserver work.


3. Use the build-review1.yaml file to create a non-working deployment. Fix the deployment such that both containers are running and in a READY state. The web server listens on port 80, and the proxy listens on port 8080.


4. View the default page of the web server. When successful verify the GET activity logs in the container log. The message should look something like the following. Your time and IP may be different.
