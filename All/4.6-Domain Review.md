4.6-Domain Review

1. Find and use the design-review1.yaml file to create a pod.



2. Determine the CPU and memory resource requirements of design-pod1.


```
cd ../All
kubectl create -f design-review1.yaml


Go to pod's exec mode 
    kubectl exec pod_name -- /bin/bash
    cd /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu 
for cpu usage run 
    cat cpuacct.usage
    cd /sys/fs/cgroup/memory 
for memory usage run 
    cat memory.usage_in_bytes

kubectl get pod design-pod1

kubectl get pod design-pod1 --output=yaml

```


3. Edit the pod resource requirements such that the CPU limit is exactly twice the amount requested by the container. (Hint: subtract .22)



4. Increase the memory resource limit of the pod until the pod shows a Running status. This may require multiple edits and attempts. Determine the minimum amount necessary for the Running status to persist at least a minute.


5. Use the design-review2.yaml file to create several pods with various labels.


6. Using only the –selector value tux to delete only those pods. This should be half of the pods. Hint, you will need to view pod settings to determine the key value as well.


7. Create a new cronjob which runs busybox and the sleep 30 command. Have the cronjob run every three minutes. View the job status to check your work. Change the settings so the pod runs 10 minutes from the current time, every week. For example, if the current time was 2:14PM, I would configure the job to run at 2:24PM, every Monday.


8. Delete any objects created during this review. You may want to delete all but the cronjob if you’d like to see if it runs in 10 minutes. Then delete that object as well.
