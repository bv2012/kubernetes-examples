7.3: Exposing Applications- Domain Review

1. Create a new pod called webone, running the nginx service. Expose port 80.


2. Create a new service named webone-svc. The service should be accessible from outside the cluster.


3. Update both the pod and the service with selectors so that traffic for to the service IP shows the web server content.


4. Change the type of the service such that it is only accessible from within the cluster. Test that exterior access no longer works, but access from within the node works.


5. Deploy another pod, called webtwo, this time running the wlniao/website image. Create another service, called webtwo-svc such that only requests from within the cluster work. Note the default page for each server is distinct.


6. Install and configure an ingress controller such that requests for webone.com see the nginx default page, and requests for webtwo.org see the wlniao/website default page.


7. Remove any resources created in this review.
